#  Brain Tumor Classification with ResNet18

This project leverages deep learning to classify brain tumors from MRI images into four distinct classes: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, and **No Tumor**. It uses a ResNet18-based convolutional neural network trained on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle and visualizes results using Tableau.

##  Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Brain Tumor Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)
- Total Images: 7,023 MRI scans
- Classes:
  - **Glioma**
  - **Meningioma**
  - **Pituitary**
  - **No Tumor**

---

##  Model

- Architecture: **ResNet18**
- Training Time: **10 epochs**
- Final Accuracy: **99.72%**

The model was trained using PyTorch with data augmentation, cross-entropy loss, and standard training-validation splitting.

##  Tableau Dashboard

The results of the model are visualized in an interactive **Tableau dashboard** showing:

- üìå Prediction vs True Label counts (Bar chart)
- üß† Accuracy and loss over epochs
- üîç Model type and final test accuracy (KPIs)
- üìä Tumor class distribution
- ‚úÖ Number of records and correctly predicted samples
